# STM Driver Projects

This is my ongoing collection of **STM32 driver development projects** where I dive deep into writing low-level, register-based code using **CMSIS**.

While I occasionally use **HAL** when it makes sense, most of the work here avoids it the goal is to understand what is s really happening under the hood.

These projects are part of my **learning and exploration** as I build **reusable drivers** for GPIO, timers, interrupts, and more. It is a hands-on space to sharpen **embedded systems skills** beyond abstraction layers and auto-generated code.
